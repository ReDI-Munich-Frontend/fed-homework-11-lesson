Homework for lesson 11 - DOM Part2

## To Do
Further advance your movie application.
Add three buttons for the jury to highlight nominees, winners, and to clear the highlights.
Nominees could for example be highlighted by blue boxes while winners would be highlighted by enlarging the
corresponding card and color it in gold.
Other than that be creative!
